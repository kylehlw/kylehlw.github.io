# About Me

Hi, I'm Kyle Huang. I'm a [...] based in China, Suzhou.

I started this blog as a way to document my experiments with Linux tools, share tips on system administration, keep notes on topics like shell scripting and Others. My goal is to solidify my own understanding and hopefully help others who are learning too.

Thanks for stopping by!
